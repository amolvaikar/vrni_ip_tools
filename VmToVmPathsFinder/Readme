On demo or POC systems, it is at times a bit difficult to find VMs that can be used to demo the VM to VM path.
Hence we have this script that should help find out the possible candidates for VM to VM path.

How to run this script:

python vm_to_vm_path_finder.py -d <IP/FQDN of platform> -u <AD or local user id used in vrni> -p <password>

e.g.:
python vm_to_vm_path_finder.py -d 10.79.41.35 -u admin@local -p admin

Sample output at the time of writing this Readme:
<Response [200]>
Found 15 VMs across 13 L2 networks
Please wait...
Path from VM app_vm2 to VM db_vm2 could work, but only in virtual network
Path from VM app_vm2 to VM Sumant-vm-1 could have physical routers
Path from VM app_vm2 to VM Sumant-vm-2 could have physical routers
Path from VM app_vm2 to VM AirtelVm1 could have physical routers, but only a **PARTIAL** path
Path from VM app_vm2 to VM web_vm2 could work, but only in virtual network
Path from VM app_vm2 to VM VM-1-host24-n5k-asa could have physical routers
Path from VM app_vm2 to VM Ubuntu-7GB could have physical routers, but only a **PARTIAL** path
Path from VM app_vm2 to VM VM-3-host24-n5k-asa could have physical routers
Path from VM app_vm2 to VM VM-2-host24-n5k-asa could have physical routers
Path from VM app_vm2 to VM db_vm1 could have physical routers
...

Logic used in the script:

1. Connect to vrni platform
2. Find all VM name, model-key & L2 id such that those VMs satisfy all the basic criteria needed for VM to VM path, like
   being powered on, having right VM Tools, having a default gateway etc.
3. Group the VMs on the basis of VLAN/L2 that they are connect to - this is done because there is not much
   fun in showing VM to VM path for VMs on same VLAN.
4. Pick a VM from one VLAN, another VM from a different VLAN, ask vrni to find out the VM to VM path for those VMs.
   If the path exists, and if it has any physical devices in the path, print out the VM names along with appropriate message.

Currently this happens sequentially (i.e. in single thread)
If/When time permits, I plan to do step 4 using a thread pool so that we can get the results a bit faster.

Feel free to reach out to me/Martijn if you want any improvements to the script based on your field/practical experience.
