Small tools for leveraging vRNI capabilities for IPAM like solutions

1. EmailSummarySender: Script to generate network and problems summary. Can be run via. cron at a 24 hr interval to get daily emails with summary. WIP for adding more information to this.

2. FreeIPFinder: Looking for next free IP to use in your datacenter? Dont know which ones are used and which are free? This script will find those for you

3. SlackHelper: Script to periodically pull events from vRNI and send them to slack. Run it in cron with whatever frequency you want.

4. VmToVmPathsFinder: Giving demo to customers on their new setups and dont know which VM to VM paths will work? Use this script to find all demoable vm to vm paths.

5. IPTroubleShooter: This is not complete. Aim is that if an IP is unreachable, customer can run this script for the IP and the script will find all possible issues in reachability.
